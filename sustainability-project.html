				<p>
					Lululemon request was to update their previous outdated design for this website. I was given the design and implemented it using Wordpress. The purpose was to deliver an appealing website where people could learn about the difference projects that contribute to Lululemon's sustainability values and also for people to learn more about the materials that are used on their manufacturing. 
				</p>
				<p>
					Within 4 weeks I succesfully deliver this website, most of the content of this site is managed content. Making it very easy for the website updates to be performed without the help of a technical party. 
				</p>
				<p>Technologies used on this project: Wordpress, HTML, Jquery, CSS, MySql and Omniture.</p>
